# Attack Forecast and Prediction
Teamprojekt Wirtschaft und Technologie SoSe 2021


In this Repository, you will find a portfolio including all the work we have done for the Teamprojekt summer semester 2021.


CODE: Here, you find a collection of all our approaches, from the data scraping to the finish prediction algorithms. In the individual files, the results of the algorithms are saved. In the file "Data", we have organised all the data used for the algorithms, starting with the data we downloaded from the MITRE ATT&CK website.

PAPER: We have documented our research and uploaded a proposal for the cyber-security conference C&ESAR and our final paper.

OTHER: In this file, we added some documents that document our research process during the semester.
